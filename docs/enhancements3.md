## I. Advanced Generator & Tooling Features (1-10)

1.  **Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Generator**: A simple cross-platform GUI (e.g., using Dear ImGui, bundled with the generator) that allows researchers to select options with checkboxes and file pickers instead of using the command line.
2.  **Web-Based Generator Interface**: A local web server that provides a web interface for the generator, allowing for a more modern and user-friendly configuration experience.
3.  **Plugin Architecture for Generator**: Allow third parties to add new project templates, build systems, or code snippets (e.g., a new cognitive task) by dropping a plugin file into a directory.
4.  **Project "Upgrade" Feature**: A tool that can take a project generated with an older version of the template and apply the new version's changes, preserving user modifications.
5.  **Visual Project Structure Preview**: In the generator's UI, show a live tree view of the project structure as the user selects different options.
6.  **Remote Configuration Fetching**: Allow the generator to fetch a configuration profile from a URL, enabling teams to share standard project setups.
7.  **Template Versioning and Pinning**: Allow the generator to use a specific version of a template (e.g., `--template-version 1.2`), ensuring reproducibility.
8.  **Automatic Documentation Generation for Generated Code**: Create a `docs/` folder with Markdown files that document the generated classes and functions based on the user's configuration.
9.  **Interactive Tutorial Mode**: A generator flag (`--tutorial`) that walks a new user through the generation process, explaining each choice.
10. **Code Generation via Source-to-Source Transformation**: Instead of string replacement, use a more robust C++ source-to-source library (like Clang LibTooling) for safer and more complex code modifications.
