# 50 Enhancements for Mental Health Research Apps

This document lists 50 potential enhancements for the C++ Template Generator, specifically tailored to the needs of creating applications for mental health research. These features focus on data integrity, security, participant management, and integration with research workflows.

---

## I. Data Collection & Security

1.  **Encrypted Data Storage**: Generate code templates for encrypting data at rest using strong, standard C++ cryptography methods (without external libs, this would mean implementing a known standard like AES, which is complex but feasible).
2.  **Secure Data Transmission Module**: Generate a placeholder module for HTTPS or other secure communication, with clear comments on where to integrate a platform-specific API.
3.  **Anonymous ID Generation**: Create a utility function that generates a unique, anonymous participant ID for each app instance to protect user privacy.
4.  **Data Obfuscation Helpers**: Generate helper functions to strip personally identifiable information (PII) from text-based log entries before saving.
5.  **Local Data Export**: Generate functions to export user data into a secure, encrypted local file (e.g., a password-protected ZIP archive).
6.  **Configurable Data Deletion**: Add options in the generated app to allow participants to delete all their data, complying with data protection regulations.
7.  **Timestamping with Millisecond Precision**: Ensure all data points are timestamped with high precision for accurate event logging.
8.  **Data Integrity Checks**: Generate code that creates checksums or hashes for data files to ensure they haven't been tampered with.
9.  **In-Memory Data Handling**: Provide templates that prioritize handling sensitive data in memory and minimizing disk writes.
10. **Role-Based Access Placeholders**: For apps that might have a researcher-facing side, generate placeholder code for a simple role-based access control system (e.g., participant vs. researcher roles).

## II. Participant Interaction & Management

11. **Informed Consent Form Template**: Generate a skippable, one-time view that displays a consent form from a text file before the app starts.
12. **Participant Demographics Form**: Generate a simple, customizable form to collect demographic information at the start of the study.
13. **Scheduled Notifications (Placeholder)**: Generate placeholder code for scheduling local notifications (e.g., for daily check-ins), with comments on how to implement this per-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).
14. **Customizable Questionnaires**: Create a module that can parse a simple text file format to dynamically generate questionnaires within the app.
15. **Likert Scale UI Element**: Generate a reusable console-based UI element for displaying a 1-to-5 or 1-to-7 Likert scale for participant responses.
16. **Visual Analog Scale (VAS) UI Element**: Generate a console UI for a VAS, where a user can move a cursor along a line to give a rating.
17. **Randomized Timed Prompts**: Generate a system for prompting the user for input at random intervals within a specified time block (Ecological Momentary Assessment).
18. **A/B Testing Framework**: Add a project option that generates a simple framework to assign participants to Group A or Group B, showing slightly different versions of the app.
19. **Session Management**: Generate code to track user sessions, logging start and end times.
20. **"Pilot Mode" vs "Study Mode"**: Add a build flag that changes app behavior, e.g., "pilot mode" could have more debugging info, while "study mode" is for deployment.

## III. Research-Specific Functionality

21. **Event Logging System**: Create a robust event logging system that can log specific user interactions (e.g., button clicks, time spent on a page) to a structured log file (e.g., CSV, TSV).
22. **Reaction Time Measurement**: Generate a module to accurately measure reaction times between a prompt and a user's key press.
23. **Cognitive Task Templates**: Add new project templates for common cognitive tasks, such as:
    - **Stroop Test**: A template for a simple Stroop task.
    - **N-Back Test**: A template for a working memory N-Back task.
    - **Go/No-Go Task**: A template for a response inhibition Go/No-Go task.
24. **Physiological Data Logging (Placeholder)**: Generate placeholder classes and functions for integrating with hardware like heart rate monitors, with clear comments on where to add SDK code.
25. **Study Protocol Scripting**: Create a system where the flow of the study (e.g., show survey, then do task, then show another survey) can be defined in a simple script or config file.
26. **Randomization Engine**: Generate a utility class for randomizing trial order, stimulus presentation, or participant group assignment.
27. **Counterbalancing Logic**: Add a module that helps with counterbalancing the order of tasks or stimuli across participants.
28. **Data Export to CSV/TSV**: Enhance the data export functionality to specifically support CSV and TSV formats, which are universally compatible with statistical software.
29. **Inter-App Communication (Placeholder)**: Generate placeholder code for apps that might need to communicate with other processes on the same machine (e.g., for stimulus presentation).
30. **App Versioning for Research**: Automatically embed the project version and a Git commit hash (if available) into the app, so data files can be traced back to the exact code version that generated them.

## IV. Generator & Build System Enhancements

31. **Headless Application Template**: Create a new project template for a "headless" application that runs in the background as a daemon or service to log data without a UI.
32. **Dependency-Free Data Visualization**: Generate code that can output simple data visualizations as text (e.g., ASCII bar charts of mood ratings) or basic SVG files.
33. **Cross-Platform Build Scripting**: Generate a single `build.sh` or `build.bat` script that abstracts away the platform-specific details of compilation.
34. **"Portable Mode" Option**: Add an option that ensures the generated application stores all its data in the same directory it's run from, making it easy to run from a USB drive.
35. **Minimalist UI Template**: Create a project template with a very plain, distraction-free UI, suitable for tasks requiring high concentration.
36. **Offline-First Design**: Generate projects that are designed to work entirely offline, storing all data locally until an explicit export is triggered. This is crucial for privacy and for use in environments without internet.
37. **Configurable Logging Levels**: Generate a logger with different levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, ERROR, DATA), so that raw data logging can be separated from debug info.
38. **Data Dictionary Generation**: Automatically generate a `data_dictionary.md` file that describes the format of the output data files (e.g., "Column 1: participant_id, string").
39. **Reproducible Build Flags**: Add compiler and linker flags that help ensure the binary is as reproducible as possible across different machines.
40. **Unit Test for Data Formatting**: When generating a project, also generate a unit test that validates the correctness of the data export format.

## V. Ethical & Compliance Features

41. **Privacy Policy Template**: Generate a `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` file with a boilerplate template that researchers can fill in.
42. **Debriefing Form Template**: At the end of a study, the app can be configured to show a "debriefing" screen with information for the participant.
43. **Contact Information Screen**: Generate a dedicated, easily accessible screen or menu option that displays contact information for the research team.
44. **"Pause Study" Functionality**: Allow a participant to pause their participation, which would halt all data collection and notifications until they resume.
45. **Data Export Password Protection**: When exporting data, prompt the user to protect the archive with a password.
46. **Audit Trail Logging**: Generate a separate, internal log that tracks major events like "data exported," "consent given," "data deleted" for auditing purposes.
47. **Clear Data Storage Location Info**: The generated README should clearly state where the application stores its data on the user's computer.
48. **No Default Network Connectivity**: Ensure that generated projects, by default, do not contain any code that makes network connections, unless explicitly chosen.
49. **Emergency "Stop" Button**: For potentially distressing tasks, generate a highly visible "Stop" button that immediately ends the task and returns to a neutral screen.
50. **Age Gate / Eligibility Check**: Generate a simple, initial form to verify participant eligibility based on criteria defined in a config file (e.g., age > 18).
